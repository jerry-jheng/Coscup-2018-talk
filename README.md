Design and implement a layer 2 protocol called BOLT, booster of ledger technology which helps to solve the scalability problem on Ethereum mainnet.

・Research other off-chain protocols to find any potential possibility to enhance BOLT protocol.

・Design a blockchain as a service system based on BOLT protocol to serve people who are not familiar with blockchain technology and want to speed up their blockchain transactions.

・Design server side and client side SDKs to integrate with BOLT protocol.

・Design a React Native library which support BOLT protocol and be used in our white-label hot wallet product. The wallet itself support off-chain micropayment, instant withdrawal and transferring ETH and ERC20 assets between Etherem mainnet and booster.

To learn more about BOLT protocol, you can read our yellow paper on github.
